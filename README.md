INM706 coursework code

Please note:
(1) The requirements.txt file was downloaded from the wandb files for run bumbling-shape-10 as I was not sure how to create a requirements file.
(2) There is no bash script because I was running locally and I am not familiar with writing bash scripts. That said I did create virtual environments to run the code locally.
(3) The file database_scratchpad is a jupyter notebook that I used when building the new database.py file and also contains beginning of work on text generation.
